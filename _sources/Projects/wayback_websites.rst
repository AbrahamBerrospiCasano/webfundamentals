The Wayback Machine
===================

In this project you will choose a website from history that you can find using the `Wayback Machine <http://archive.org>`_

* Find a website using the wayback machine. (archive.org) or some other source of old 90’s sites.
* Recreate that website using only html — no css, no frameworks, no javascript
* Does not have to be live — that is if there are input elements then they don’t need to work.
* You will host this on GitHub using GitHub pages (talk about that on Wednesday)
* Your page should have a live link back to the page you are modeling.
* Your site should use both block and inline elements and should be moderately complex.  Google from Feb 8 1999 is about what I’m looking for.  http://itcorp.com/ - registered 1986 - would not.
