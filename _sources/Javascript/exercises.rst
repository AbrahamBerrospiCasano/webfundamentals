Javascript Exercises
====================


#. Make a simple web page that contains a button and a paragraph with the id of ``count`` Whenever this button is pressed increment the count by 1 and update the paragraph text.  Also update the font size so that as the number gets larger, so does the font.

  .. actex:: ex_js_1
     :language: html

     <html>



     </html>


#. Repeat the previous exercise but make a list of numbers.  In this case you will not be able to simply update the innerHTML of the paragraph, you will need to use the ``document.createElement()`` and ``document.appendChild()`` functions to add a new list item.
